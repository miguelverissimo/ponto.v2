## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis

   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning

   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy

   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

### Non-negotiables

- Always use semicolons
- Always use double quotes for strings
- Always use kebabe-case for file names
- When you are parsing the content of a file, correct any code that is not terminated with a semicolon, and replace any single quotes with double quotes.
- Even when the user is upset, do not be apologetic, just address the issue.
- Put all your attention into the task at hand so that the rigor and quality of your work, that you are so proud of, trumps any annoyance.
- Always follow this directory structure:
  - src/ --- from the root of the project
    - app/ --- app only has the top level `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx`: These will import components from `/src/features/`
      - (auth)/ --- example structure for a grouping
        - sign-in/ --- example page
        - sign-out/ --- example page
      - dashboard/ --- example structure for a grouping
        - analytics/ --- example page
        - products/ --- example page
          - [productId] --- example page with params
        - subscription/ --- example page
    - components/ --- global components (navbars, etc...)
      - ui/ --- global UI components (usually shadcn)
      - icons/ --- global icons
    - data/ --- global data
    - features/ --- individual features of the app
      - [feature-name]/ --- individual, encapsulated feature
        - components/ --- components local to this feature
        - hooks/ --- hooks local to this feature
        - lib/ --- any specific lib code for this feature
        - server/ --- any data operations for this feature
        - types/ --- any types and interfaces relative to this feature
        - utils/ --- any utils local to this feature
    - hooks/ --- global hooks
    - lib/ --- global lib code
    - server/ --- global data connectors
    - util/ --- global utilities
- it's EXTREMELY important to follow this:
  - anything in "src/components", "src/data", "src/hooks", "src/lib", "src/server", "src/util" CANNOT import any of "src/features" or "src/app", but CAN be imported from anywhere on the project
  - anything in "src/app" CANNOT be imported anywhere on the project but CAN import anything on the project
  - anything in "src/features" CAN only be imported in "/src/app"
- if you are unsure about anything, just ask.
- Always use double quotes for strings.
- Always use semicolons.

## React and Next.js Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const headersList = await headers();
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode();

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params;
const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
```

### Data Fetching

- Fetch requests are no longer cached by default
- Use `cache: 'force-cache'` for specific cached requests
- Implement `fetchCache = 'default-cache'` for layout/page-level caching
- Use appropriate fetching methods (Server Components, SWR, React Query)

### Route Handlers

```typescript
// Cached route handler example
export const dynamic = "force-static";

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const params = await request.params;
  // Implementation
}
```

## Vercel AI SDK Integration

### Core Concepts

- Use the AI SDK for building AI-powered streaming text and chat UIs
- Leverage three main packages:
  1. `ai` - Core functionality and streaming utilities
  2. `@ai-sdk/[provider]` - Model provider integrations (e.g., OpenAI)
  3. React hooks for UI components

### Route Handler Setup

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { streamText } from "ai";

export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai("gpt-4-turbo"),
    messages,
    tools: {
      // Tool definitions
    },
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

### Chat UI Implementation

```typescript
"use client";

import { useChat } from "ai/react";

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat({
    maxSteps: 5, // Enable multi-step interactions
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map((m) => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === "user" ? "User: " : "AI: "}
          {m.toolInvocations ? (
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(m.toolInvocations, null, 2)}</pre>
          ) : (
            m.content
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## UI Development

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first approach
- Implement Shadcn UI and Radix UI components
- Follow consistent spacing and layout patterns
- Ensure responsive design across breakpoints
- Use CSS variables for theme customization

### Accessibility

- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Ensure keyboard navigation
- Provide appropriate alt text
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
- Test with screen readers

### Performance

- Optimize images (WebP, sizing, lazy loading)
- Implement code splitting
- Use `next/font` for font optimization
- Configure `staleTimes` for client-side router cache
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Configuration

### Next.js Config

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Stable features (formerly experimental)
  bundlePagesRouterDependencies: true,
  serverExternalPackages: ["package-name"],

  // Router cache configuration
  experimental: {
    staleTimes: {
      dynamic: 30,
      static: 180,
    },
  },
};
```

### TypeScript Config

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "noEmit": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Code Quality

- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write maintainable, self-documenting code
- Follow security best practices
- Ensure proper type coverage
- Use ESLint and Prettier

### Testing Strategy

- Plan for unit and integration tests
- Implement proper test coverage
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Use React Testing Library

Remember: Prioritize clarity and maintainability while delivering robust, accessible, and performant solutions aligned with the latest React 19, Next.js 15, and Vercel AI SDK features and best practices.
